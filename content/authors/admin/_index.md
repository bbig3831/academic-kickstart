I studied math at the University of California, Davis before going to HSPH to get my masters in global health. While in school, my thesis research focused on hospital operations in Ethiopia, but I also interned at the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, where I worked on state policy research. After graduating, I came down to DC to join a population health tech company as a data analyst/product developer. Currently, I work at Hospital IQ, a software company that provides an operations management platform for hospitals. I manage our projects and relationships with hospital IT teams and integrate their data feeds into our platform.
