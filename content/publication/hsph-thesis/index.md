abstract: "The application of operations management techniques in the Ethiopian health system has been understudied. Additionally, although previous research has outlined limitations of paper-based records, few researchers have examined their potential utility for  improving hospital operations. In this thesis, we used data collected from paper registries in an Ethiopian obstetrics ward to develop models of the wardâ€™s operations. With logistic regression models, we first attempted to identify predictors of lengthy stays and readmissions among women giving birth. Due to missing and  incomplete data, few predictors were deemed significant. Time series methods for demand forecasting were applied to the data and evaluated with several error metrics. The forecasts had some limitations but were improvements over baseline methods.
We conclude with recommendations on how the obstetrics ward could
incorporate our models into their operations."
