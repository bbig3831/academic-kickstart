## What I'm doing

I guess the first thing I've done today is deploy this website via Netlify. Not that it counts as much, but I'll take what I can get. Certainly not the first time I've tried to commit to maintaining a website, so we'll see where this thing goes.

Lately I've also been working on updates to a paper I wrote in graduate school, but I'm looking forward to getting back to some of my other ongoing projects. I'm still building out a Flask app with an analysis of hospital prices and I need to get started on a research letter about wage garnishment and retainers-in-debt for medical debt. Looks like I've found what I'll be working on tonight.

## What I'm reading

I wrapped up Matt Taibbi's _Spanking the Donkey_ a few days ago and am still heading down the trail into his raucous writing, picking up _Insane Clown President_, a sister campaign diary. Twelve years after _Spanking the Donkey_ was written and you see the same media myopia. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

I'm getting towards the end of _King Leopold's Ghost_. Adam Hochschild has a remarkable ability to judge history in a fair manner, comparing and contrasting the good that someone like E.D. Morel did with his somewhat naive, if orthodox at the time, thoughts on things like free trade.

## What I'm learning

Hugo, for one. Flask, for another. I've seesawed between two video courses, neither of which is very good, but they both have occassional nuggets of insight on code patterns that I know I can use.
