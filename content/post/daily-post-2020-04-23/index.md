## What I'm doing

Unfortunately, I got sucked into a black hole of looking at campaign finance records for Virginia for about 2 hours. It's one of those things that I'm sure is boring for lots of people, but I find it pretty interesting. I'm sure there's a web app to built with this data, especially since it's publically available and kept up-to-date by the Virginia Department of Elections.

## What I'm learning

I'm moving along in the _Ultimate Flask_ course I've been taken, but I'm a little disappointed so far. It's quite slow and the instructor doesn't do a good job of explaining things. What I really want is a course that helps me understand how to set up and handle database connections and things that help data-driven apps run. I'm still pretty vague on the best practices for that sort of thing.

## What I'm reading

Popped off of _Joe Gould's Secret_, onwards into _Vicksburg, 1863_. I wonder how it ends...
