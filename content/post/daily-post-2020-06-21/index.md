Today was a slow Sunday, which is a good thing. But I did take some time to start a new course on the Django framework for Python.

I was working through the 100 Days of Web course on Talk Python, but the sections on Django and React went a little over my head. I couldn't quite figure out what the utility of React was or how I could use. I got the gist of JavaScript, which seems like a cool thing to have in my toolbox, especially to do more front-end work. So I poked around on O'Reilly and found out that Brad Traversy had a Django course that covered a lot of material. I enjoyed his Bootstrap course, so I decided to give it a go. The course's main project also seems directionally similar to something I've been working on in Flask, but I might end up porting over to Django instead.

I haven't gotten too far yet, but I can tell already that Django is _a lot_ more robust than Flask, with a whole slew of things to understand and take care of. My small win of the night: getting the Django server running in PyCharm using PyCharm's configurations instead of running `manage.py` from the terminal. Great success!
