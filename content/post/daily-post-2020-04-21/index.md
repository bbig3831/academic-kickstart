## What I'm doing

Today was a lot of paper editing, sadly. Looking over things for the umpteenth time. A necessary evil, I guess.

Still, I managed to get some time to work on the _Extreme Markup_ project and wrote the content for the "About" page. Not major compared to the data viz stuff I got done this weekend, but every little bit moves things forward. I can tell the project is almost done and that makes me quite excited.

## What I'm learning

Learning by doing, I'm afraid. No time for coursework today, although I did have some Toastmasters stuff to go through yesterday.

## What I'm reading

_Joe Gould's Secret_ by Joseph Mitchell. Not really a fan so far. Joe Gould has his moments of insight, such as his critiques of the upper-class proletariat bohemians in Greenwich Village, that are quite pointed and funny, but I find his behavior leans into the narcissistic. In all cases, it's a short book, a compilation of two _New Yorker_ profiles, so it ain't gonna take me too long to get through.
