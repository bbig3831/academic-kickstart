## What I'm doing

Today was more of a learning day than a doing day. What little I did do was mostly restructuring of a Python project I started a few months ago to look at medical debt cases in Virginia courts. Based on the Flask course I just finished, I laid out the directory in a more organized fashion and refactored some of the basic code I had written to match the structure taught by the _Talk Python_ Flask course, using views, blueprints, tests, etc.

## What I'm learning

Finally wrapped up the Data-Driven Web Apps with Flask course. Learned all about setting up your Linux servers on Digital Ocean and migrating your SQLAlchemy/DB stuff from SQLite to MongoDB. Interesting, although I didn't understand much of it. I think it's something I'll revisit for the next web app I deploy. The one thing mentioned that I did find interesting, however, is that you can run multiple web apps on the same server by writing different Nginx configurations. Pretty cool and a great way to save money.

## What I'm reading

I recently started _The Image_ by Daniel J. Boorstin. His book focuses on the notion of pseudo-events and their various manifestations, e.g. the democratization and homogenization of travel, the reliance of the press on government press releases and press conferences, the replacement of heroes with celebrities. Some of seems quite dated, and Boorstin definitely meanders a bit while making his points. But what's remarkable is how well his points hold up.

For example, there was an article I read in the past few months about the homogenous style of coffee shops all around the world. The reclaimed wood tables, the industrial lighting, stainless steel apparrati. Coffee shops in Berlin look like coffee shops in Portland. Ditto for web design, with landing pages styled in ["Corporate Memphis"](https://www.are.na/claire-l-evans/corporate-memphis). (Personally, I've always found these cartoonish characters pushing and pulling and pointing at indistinguishable gravitating widgets for some nebulous purpose to be quite annoying. It may be the fact that these websites are almost always built by startups and the startups market themselves with the same jargon: sleek, elegant, simple, beautiful, fast, etc.)

So as much as Boorstin's apparent adoration of "the good ol' days" can be grating, his observations on contemporary culture and trends still hold weight.
